This is a mod for the Unciv game. It adds a religion named "Christianity" (in case that the ruleset doesn't have it but your civilizations need it) with a distinct symbol (the Jesus fish).

### Note

* If the ruleset already has the religion, the symbol (usually a cross) will be replaced, and you'll likely see two religions having the same name and symbol.
